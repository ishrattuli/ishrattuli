                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Susan Sontag, In Plato’s Cave, said: “To collect photographs is to collect the world”. Movies and television may be able to represent and recreate lifestyle and events, but they aren’t raw. I believe that still images carry feelings, capturing fleeting moments that stay trapped in time. In this context, “trapped” does not carry a negative connotation. Trapping a moment in time is not only a simple proof of the experience, but nowadays a requirement in everyday life. Photographs are evidence, as the famous saying suggests: seeing is believing. This is not to say that photographs are definite, when in fact the very basis of art is interpretation. Photography is a debated art form, as the result is not usually something created, but captured. So, the argument goes, does capturing the essence of a moment count as a form of creation? And, just because we can, should we? To be able to capture or create means to be able to portray something that someone else may not have been able to, and this is a special privilege.
                </p>
                    To me, capture and create are steps one and two. You can only create art if you have seen it. Painting is an extension of photography, or perhaps vice versa. Photography has been based off of instinct for me, not an event or setting itself. Clicking the shutter button, often, because it just felt right. I believe in the sentiment more than the value. Susan Sontag stated, “It [to photograph] means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge and, therefore, like power.” To photograph is to become one with what you capture, to carry the responsibility of solidifying this moment, and its feelings, in time. This manifests itself into power, then, when you have the sole ability to display or hide this from the world. Similarly, creating graphics or illustrations carries the same weight. Essentially, to create is to have power.
                </p>
                    Whether in photography, painting, graphic design, or writing, I aim to have multiple dimensions to my work. A good photograph will make the viewer feel and wonder if there is more to be discovered inside it. I don’t shy away from blurry or “wrong” photos, finding more satisfaction in them than completely perfect ones. Graphic design, through the lens of marketing, should be attention-grabbing, make you wonder how much more you can discover, and make you want to indulge. Ultimately, to capture and create means to take a stagnant scene in time and morph it into something beyond its surface level, making the audience wonder what the original ever was. On Photography states that “The ultimate wisdom of the photographic image is to say: ‘There is the surface. Now think - or rather feel, intuit - what is beyond it, what the reality must be like if it looks  this  way.’”. Similar to how Journalism is regarded as the “first draft of history”, photographs follow suit. To be able to capture means wielding power, and I practice photography with this in mind, believing that emotion leaves an impression and remembering that not everything is easy to comprehend.
