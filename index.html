 <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>My work is all about interpretation. The idea that there is more than what meets the eye. I gain inspiration from the genre of impressionism art, adopting the styles of artists such as Edgar Degas. I portray this concept by capturing fleeting, real-life moments with blurry and 'unblended' photographs. I find meaning behind the simple, knowing that there is always more to see. I aim for vibrance when working with any medium, emphasizing light. </p>
